# Overview

Tor's [ContactInfo](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#ContactInfo) 
[descriptor field](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n608) was primarily
intended to contain an email address and PGP key fingerprint but since this field accepts an arbitrary string
it has been used for multiple other purposes (website urls, donation information, bitcoin addresses, ...).
Making use of provided information in an automated way is hard since there is no specification on how 
this string should look like. This is an specification to formalize the ContactInfo string.


# Motivation

- increase the information sharing among tor relay operators
- make it easier for current and future relay operators to find (rarely used) hosters for tor relays
by increasing the information sharing between relay operators. 	-> help the tor network grow
- (indirectly) improve geo- and autonomous system diversity on the tor network (more diverse is better)
- collect additional (self-reported) relay metrics (for things like [Relay Search](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html) and [OrNetStats](https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats))
- examples: How many use tor's Sandbox/OfflineMasterMode/KIST feature?
- This data could provide tor developers with information on how well tested/how much used new features (like Sandboxes) are before changing defaults. 
- improve the ability to contact relay operators (automatically)
- make provided information machine readable 
- provide the foundation for an automated contactInfo verification bot. 
- Mutually verified email addresses (and other contact options) could be displayed differently on [Relay Search](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html)
- make tor t-shirt delivery easier since contact information is potentially already verified
- increase the ability to detect undeclared relay groups / make hiding relay groups harder
- make hosting costs visible
- potentially detect relay operators impersonating other operators by using their email address


# Considerations

-  increases exposure of relay operators 

The machine readable information could be used by spammers and to target
relay operators. 
Operators concerned about this can omit contact information
but it should not be hard to create a new email address for the purpose .

- more information makes targeted exploitation easier / more silent

Attackers could use the additional information provided in these fields to specifically
target only vulnerable systems. Operators concerned about sharing configuration information 
should omit this type of information, but can share other information.

- increased descriptor size and directory traffic

The contactinfo field size could potentially grow because of this specification.
This is expected to be mitigated by directory data compression and diffs available since tor 0.3.1.

- ContactInfo size constraints

According to the [manual](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#ContactInfo) there is no explicit 
ContactInfo size limit but there is a descriptor size limit. 
The [max. descriptor size](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n364) is 20000 bytes. 
The family size (number of listed fingerprints) and exit policy are two other relevant inputs.

# Defined Fields 

The fields specified in this document coexists with other arbibrary strings located in 
the relay's ContactInfo descriptor field. Defined fields may appear at any position within 
the contactInfo string. A field identifier (key) MUST only be used once, if it appears multiple times
in the ContactInfo string only the first occurance is considered. **Non-ASCII characters are not supported.**

Information is provided in key-value pairs:

```key ":" value WS key ":" value ...```

keys and values MUST NOT contain spaces.
WS is a single or multiple whitespace characters (space, tab, ..).
The order of keys is not mandatory but SHOULD follow the order in which they appear in this specification.
Specifically the email field SHOULD be the first field.

## example
An example contactInfo string as defined by this document could look like this:

```foo bar email:user[]example-operator.com hoster:www.example-hoster.com uplinkbw:100 trafficacct:unmetered cost:10.00USD virtualization:xen```


## contact information

At least one of the fields in this section MUST be provided.

the "@" sign SHOULD be replaced with "[]". 
We are aware that this is trivially defeated anti-spam "protection" but 
not all email address scrappers are aware of this specification
(not targeted for tor contact info data).
International non-ASCII email addresses are NOT supported.

example value:

```contact[]example.com```

### pgp
